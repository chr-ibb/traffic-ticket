I want to make a simple project website where the user can search for their traffic ticket and then "pay" the fine. For tech stack, I want to use Angular for front end, Java with spring board for back end, and sqlite for the database. The user can look up their ticket by either using their car's licence plate number, or by using their driver's licence number. The website will show any matching tickets. The user can click on a ticket to open up a popup where they can see the details and there will be a back button or a pay button. clicking the pay button just goes to a page with a reciept and a thank you message. The database should have 2 tables. One table will have the columns ticket number (random 10 digit number), ticket type (parking ticket or speeding ticket), licence plate number (random 7 characters, letters or numbers), fine amount (dollar amount), and due date. The second table will have the columns licence plate number, driver's licence number, last name, first name. 

Before we start on the project, I want you to make me a markdown file explaining the project, including a Project overview section, a Technology Stack section, and a Core Features section.
